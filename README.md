The results visualised here are based on Table B1 in the Appendix: they are the Average Marginal Component Effect (AMCE) based on an OLS regression. The dependent variable is respondent's willingness to have a refugee as a neighbor; to grant them with a work permit; or to extend citizenship. It is measured on a Likert scale from 0 (lack of willingness) to 1 (complete willingness). The AMCEs visualised represent the marginal effect (in percentage points change) of various refugee profile attributes on these three dependent variables.
